1. Extract `products` from the response:
   Replace `setData(Data)` with `setData(Data.products || []).`

2. Handle `loading` state properly:
   Use `setLoading(false)` after fetching is complete or in the `catch` block if an error occurs.

3. Error handling:
   Added a `catch` block to set `data` to an empty array if fetching fails.

4. Fixed typo in "No products available":
   Corrected the typo in the message.

5. Now, the `data.map` call will work correctly because `data` is guaranteed to be an array.
